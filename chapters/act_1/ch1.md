# Prologue

Rohit stepped out of his hotel room at Heritage Madurai after a simple but satisfying breakfast of pongal, medhu vada, and dosa. The day before, he had visited three temples — Meenakshi Amman, Azhagar Kovil, and Pazhamudhir Cholai. Today’s plan was straightforward: drive north to Samayapuram Mariamman temple and then continue on to Pondicherry. He was looking forward to dinner at his friend Reema’s place; her mother had promised to prepare his favorite dish. He calculated that he would be able to reach the temple an hour before it closed, givnig him plenty of time to finish his darshan.

Just as he was about to board the car, a peacock’s cry pierced the air. He looked around. He couldn't see any peacock.
Strange.

He got into the car, connected his phone to the console, and watched the map light up. On the passenger seat lay a small picture of Murugan, the one he had placed there the previous day. Even in the photograph, the boyish eyes held a depth that always unsettled him. He thought back to the moment at Pazhamudhir Cholai when he’d teared up unexpectedly at the sight of the deity.

It wasn’t surprising. Even the most stoic visitors felt something stir inside them at Murugan’s temples. Rohit had grown up hearing his stories from his grandmother — watching television serials that reenacted the god’s battles and miracles. His mother had taken him to the Arupadai Veedu during his childhood, and even after moving to Bangalore for work, he made it a point to visit all six temples every year. He adjusted the photo, resting it vertically, as if Murugan was riding in the car aloing with him.

He smiled at the memories. The tantrums, the charm, the stubbornness. Murugan was by far his favorite god — Commander of the Deva army, forever at war with the Asuras. Yet, to Rohit, He wasn’t a ferocious warlord. He was a boy — a divine child who once walked away from home over a fruit, who gifted the Tamil language to the world by teaching it to Agastya. His grandmother used to call him "Adithamizhan," the First Tamilan.

Rohit turned on the radio. Ilayaraja’s melodies filled the car, eventually giving way to Rahman. Fields rolled past, green and ready for harvest. Rain clouds gathered in patches over an otherwise blue sky. He felt full, satisfied. If he had looked up, through his car's moon roof, he would have seen the peacock that seemed to be following his car.

At 12:05 p.m., he parked at Samayapuram. The temple grounds were mercifully quiet. He purchased a garland at a flower shop, left his footwear, and walked inside. It was his first time visiting this particular temple, renowned as one of the most powerful shrines to Mariamman—the goddess of rain, fertility, and health. Legend said the idol was too powerful to remain at Srirangam, causing disturbances there until she was moved to Samayapuram.

Devotees still came from far and wide seeking her blessings. Some believed she could cure even diseases like chicken pox. Rohit’s father still kept a photo of her in his wallet.

Inside, he offered the garland to the priest and requested a pooja in her name. As the mantras washed over him, he closed his eyes and prayed—for his health, his family’s well-being, his career. The Monday presentation, the promotion he hoped for.

When he opened his eyes again, the goddess seemed to gaze at him through the dim light of the deepam. Stern, yet gentle.

He dropped a thousand rupees into the undiyal and sat with his back to the wall, passively observing the others. The birds, the chatter, the children’s laughter—loud, uncontainable. It made him smile. No divine force could keep children still.

Just as he stood to leave, his eyes landed on a woman sitting a short distance away. She wore an impossibly clean pleated saree and was tying jasmine flowers into strings, humming Tamil slokas under her breath. But that wasnt the strangest part. She was white — ethnically. Blonde hair, fair skin. And Rohit was certain she hadn’t been there a moment ago.

Something in her presence drew him in. Before he realized it, he was walking toward her.
As he neared, she looked up. Her blue eyes sparkled with mischief, but they pierced through him, as if reading his soul.

"You looked so serious during your prayer," she said, smiling. "I thought about tossing a flower at you." Her Tamil was fluent, with a musical lilt. Rohit opened his mouth, confused. He had spoken Tamil all his lift, yet he had never heard the dialect this women used. It felt ... ancient.

She continued, switching to English with a faint accent. "I can speak in English if it’s easier." She looked past Rohit, towards where his car was standing. "He always gets so lonely when he is away from home." She smiles sadly. "Thanks for driving him here." Rohit looked around confused. "I came alone, aunty" Rohit managed to stammer. The woman laughed. A loud, hearty laugh with no malice. "Traveling alone, you say? Who among us really travels alone, thambi? You drove him here, whether you realize it or not"

Rohit looked back at his car. The Murugan photo in the passenger seat seemed to wink back at him.

She patted the stone beside her. Rohit hesitated, then sat down at a respectful distance.

"Sit sit", the woman says "I dont bite, not in public at least."

Minutes passed in silence. Then she spoke again.

"You know, I see many devotees. Most claim to carry Amman and Murugan in their hearts. Few, however, place Skandha on the passenger seat like you did."

Rohit chuckled awkwardly. "That was unintentional. But I do feel like he’s always around. It’s hard to explain."

"You don’t have to explain," she said. "I know how He chooses His people. I’m waiting for one of His people too, I think."

She paused, her gaze distant now.

"But child, you only know the stories you’ve been told. His battle with Surapadman. His rise as the commander of the Deva army. His marriages. His ties to this land."

She leaned closer, her voice soft.

"But do you know the real story? The one not written in scriptures or sung in songs? The story of why the skies closed … and the supernatural disappeared from this world?"

Her eyes glinted. She seemed to have waited a long time for this.

And then, the woman in the white saree began her tale of the god he thought he knew.
