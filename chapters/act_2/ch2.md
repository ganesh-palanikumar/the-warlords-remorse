This realm was not always such a boring place. In eons past, celestials walked the earth, shoulder to shoulder with humans. Devas frequently visited rishis and kings, Gandharvas roamed the cities mesmerizing people with their art and music. You could learn music from a Gandharva and philosophy from a Yaksha without moving too far from your house. Asuras sometimes attacked but they were all kept at bay by the presence of the Velan, the Commander of the Deva armies who would come to the protection of any soul in danger. All this changed at the end of the last great war. 

I will not get into the details of the war, child. The songs are full of those, and frankly, they always leave out the most important parts. That is not what this story is about. What I will tell you, however, was that the was was long and protracted and brutal. Both sides took heavy losses. It ultimately ended with the Devas emerging victorious, lead by their Senapati, Murugan. But deep within Him, a different war was brewing.

Karthikeya sat alone amidst the carnage, the silence of the battlefield broken only by the distant crackle of flames. Deva and Asura soldiers alike lay scattered around him. The ground was soaked to a dull red from the blood of friend and foe alike. In the distance, the great Asura city burned, its walls broken, its towers consumed by an unending fire, courtesy Agni. Behind him, the jubilant shouts of the victorious Devas drifted on the wind. Soma flowed freely and celebrations were already underway. It was a decisive victory by all means. So thoroughly had they shattered the Asura ranks that they would not rise again for millennia.

Yet, as he gazed at the destruction around him, he did not feel accomplishment. He sighed as he sat down on what remained of an Asura chariot. It was the tired exhalation of a man who had fought the same war for far too long. This time, the victory felt hollow, painful even. What is the point of victory if all it entails is death?

He looked around him. A small wooden horse caught his eye. A keepsake the soldier had carried to war, maybe a memory of his child. Murugan's heart ached. How many of these Asuras had children waiting for them at home? How many orphans and widows had he created that day? Some of them were brave warriors, better than some of his own soldiers. He looked skyward, eyes moist. The stormy clouds seemed to mirror the storm he felt inside. 

One of the devas, already tipsy with the Soma and the victory, stumbled over to where Murugan sat, meaning to invite him to the celebrations. But one look of thinly veiled irritation from Murugan sent him back.

It had been millennia now. He had fought and won so many wars that he had lost count. But the same cycle repeated. The Asuras were crafty, and refused to die. They always eventually got back their numbers and attacked. But they always ran up against the one obstacle they could never overcome: himself. With Him and his Vel at the head of the Deva army, victory was all but assured. Indra had always supported him, saying that all his kills were in defense of Dharma, the order of the world. His dharma, the reason He exists, is to act as shield and sword for the heavens.

Yet, as he sat there, Murugan found himself wrestling with the very foundation of his existence: Dharma. The word had always been a guiding star, a beacon that cut through uncertainty. But now, in the aftermath of so much carnage, its light seemed dim and ambiguous. If his dharma was to fight, to lead the Deva armies in an endless cycle of war, then what justice could there be in such a fate? Each battle left him more hollow, each victory a little more bitter. The price of following this path was not only the blood of enemies, but the erosion of his own spirit.

He wondered, not for the first time, if Dharma was meant to be so burdensome. The sages spoke of it as a stream—natural, inevitable, effortless when one surrendered to its flow. But Murugan felt as if he were swimming upstream, battered by doubts and exhaustion. His heart, once buoyed by purpose, now felt heavy with the weight of lives lost and futures shattered. Was this truly the order of the cosmos, or merely the inertia of violence masquerading as divine law?

His thoughts turned to the idea of universal Dharma—the grand order that was supposed to bind gods, demons, and mortals alike. If it was truly universal, why did it need constant defense? Why was it so fragile, always teetering on the edge of chaos, always demanding vigilance and sacrifice? Why must his very existence be defined by the endless struggle to preserve something so perpetually threatened?

He looked at his hands, stained with the blood of countless foes and comrades. Was he the sword of Dharma, or merely its instrument of suffering? Was there a higher justice he could not see, or was he trapped in a cycle that no god could break? The questions gnawed at him, more relentless than any enemy he had ever faced. In that moment, Murugan realized that the greatest war he would ever fight was not against the Asuras, but within his own soul.
